There may be differences in dimension which when discovered later will impact the plan. Note down the directions (North, South, East, West) which will be useful.\nNote Talk to the neighbours and get an understanding of rain water flow in the area and if any flooding happens, this will impact the design.\nNote Sometimes dimensions will be correct but the site won't be a perfect rectangle, do check if the site corners are perpendicular.\nLegal documents Get your legal documents ready.\nTitle deed / Sale deed / Parent deed / Master deed - Agreement of sale / title - Primary document that shows who owns the property. Gift deed - Agreement of transfer of ownership in case the plot is gifted. Khata Certificate - Shows the owner of the land as per BBMP records. You get this done in your local BBMP office. Take a 1-2 week time without any bribe if all documents are in order. Encumbrance Certificate - Shows if there are any loans on the site. You get this done in your local sub-registrar office. Takes 1 month time without any bribe if all documents are in order. Vaastu Kitchen to the south east. Master bedroom to the south west. Entrance \u0026amp; Car parking in north east. Sump tank to be in the north east. Pooja room not to be next to / below / above bathrooms. Architect There are 2 types of architects in Bangalore\nArchitects who are registered with BBMP and do house plans for approval only. Architects who are not registered with BBMP and do house plans for construction. Chart out a layout of how you want the floor plan to look like, Questions to discuss with architect\nHow many members in the family? How many floors? How many bedrooms? Attached toilet for all bedrooms or common toilets? Closed car parking or open parking? Single or multiple car parking. How many floor \u0026amp; if rent out or commercial rent out is needed. Future expansion plans if any. New trends or ideas you have in mind? Space utilisation The Architect will provide\nBBMP approved plan Floor plan Electrical plan RCC Column \u0026amp; Structural plan Wardrobe layout plan Doors \u0026amp; Window dimension plan Floor Planner\nSweet Home 3D\nFree CAD\nChoices Serial car parking Vs Parallel car parking - Serial car parking makes it difficult to take 2 cars in and out. Minimum dimension should be 8'x16' to park sedan car and 8'x13 to park compact car. Parallel parking makes it easy to take 2 cars in and out. Minimum standard dimension should be 18'x16' to park 2 sedan cars and 16'x16' to park 2 compact cars. Garages can be put in the corner and you need not leave setback on side and back, this is an advantage in terms of space utilization however if you leave the complete pathway on one side you will loose more space.\nStilt Vs Ground VS Basement parking - Stilt parking efficient if parking more than 2 cars although without lifts it become difficult for old age folks to reside. Basement parking is risky in low lying areas and during rainy season the clogged drainages can lead to flooding. Basements can develop dampness if its closed it can lead to stale air and also invite roaches if windows are at ground level.\nPrivacy Vs Open spaces - If you need more privacy in the house when people visit you then you need to separate out the living and dining rooms. If you don't then you get a bigger area which is combined of living and dining.\nInverted T-Beams Vs Concealed Beams - If the room dimension is bigger than 15x15 then its ideal to go in for a T-Beam. If inverted T-Beam is used then the room ceiling looks cleaner and the room looks longer.\nGranite Vs vitrified Vs Marble - A white floor reflects more light, brightness up the room. Granite is naturally occurring stone so finding shades of white are difficult, grains without any fault line are also difficult to find. Vitrified has lot more options and cost effective but vitrified has the tendency to chip off \u0026amp; expand during summer causing them to bubble up if no expansion joint is provided. Vitrified has the tendency of chipping and cracking when heavy objects are dropped. Marble is very delicate and reacts to chemicals easily and is hard to maintain.\nCeiling height VS False ceiling - False ceiling in the long run is more difficult to maintain. Dust will gather around the false ceiling and cause health problems. Ceiling heights are standard of 10' some go to 11' making the room look bigger. If you go in for a 11' ceiling then you will pay more\nin terms of air conditioning keep that in mind.\nWood windows VS UPVC windows - Wood windows need to be painted, whereas UPVC can last longer.\nBrick Vs Cement Block - Cement block work out cheap and easy in terms of construction. Brick remain cooler in summer compared to cement brick wall. Brick outer walls are usually 9\u0026quot; and cement outer walls are usually 6\u0026quot;.\nFe415 TMT Vs Fe 500 TMT - Fe500 Steel is used in high rise buildings and bridges has more strength, for normal residential buildings Fe415 is sufficient. FE500D is more ductile than the FE500 used in the high seismic prone zones. Make sure there is no rust and its ISI marked.\nCut Lintel Vs Through Lintel - Lintel support the weight of the bricks on top of the window \u0026amp; makes sure windows dont deform. For earthquake resistance the benefit of having through lintel is that it wont allow the columns to twist. Places which have longer windows are suitable for through lintel. Make sure the alignment of columns doesn't deviate, in cut lintels the columns raise all the way upto the roof, in through lintels they raise till lintel level so extra care needs to be taken to make sure the columns don't shift from centre line.\nSunken Slab for Bathroom - If the bathroom are planned on the first floor try to align the ground floor bathroom also on the same side so that roof slab can be sunk by 6\u0026quot;. That way the pipes can be shared and the first floor bathroom will be on the same level as the floor.\nCement 43 Grade Vs 53 Grade vs PPC - For RCC columns ideally 53 Grade cement is used as it provides higher strength, it requires more water during the curing stage. 43 grade cement is used for brick work, PPC is mix of fly ash with cement this seals the minute holes in cement and requires less water to set and less cracks are seen \u0026amp; PPC based cements are used for inside wall plastering.\nSpiral Staircase vs Normal Staircase - Spiral staircase look grand but space under it is wasted. In a normal staircase the space under it can be used as cabinets. Steps should raise between 6\u0026quot; and 7\u0026quot; for comfort in climbing anything more will hurt the knees in old age. A single step should be at-least 10\u0026quot; wide (tread) to give enough footing. Use laputra finish granite for steps as it will give a rough surface and wont be slippery.\nMud bricks come in 2 varieties one that is 6 Rs/brick with rough edges used for walls, 8 Rs/Brick which has smooth edges and used when brick work is exposed.\nBBMP Approval Plan approval - You can only begin construction after plan is approved. Valid for upto 2 years. Road Cutting approval - Once construction is complete after inspection you will need road cutting permission to connect the electrical, water, sewage lines. Occupancy certificate - Indicates that house is ready to move in. Most residential houses usually don't go for this. BBMP Road cutting charges\nTips Have cross ventilation, its ideal if the rooms (Kitchen, Master bedroom) and hence these should come in the corner of the plot. Ensure slope for draining excess rain water is always provided correctly. Water should take the shortest path out of the house to prevent flooding. Two room doors should never open to each other, they should not face each other and should be seperated by some distance if possible. For safety against earthquake interlocking of RCC columns is done at plint level, you can also interlock them at lintel level. If you plan to wall mount a TV then provide a 5\u0026quot; pipe within the wall during construction to conceal all the cables. You will get a cleaner view when there are no cables dangling. If you plan to have wired network connection, iter-com, home theater \u0026amp; security camera then provide conduits accordingly. Interior walls on need 3 coats of putty, sanding with sandpaper and 1 coat primer. The 1 coat primer is applied so that the paint absorption is less else the walls will soak up more paint and it will take more paint to get the true colour on the walls. If you plan to install a chimney provide a exit hole as close to the stove as possible. A longer duct reduces effectiveness of the suction. Avoid bends in the suction pipe. Plan for a place to keep these items Washing machine Step Ladder Wet Grinder Iron board Repair Tools UPS battery The exact height for a kitchen slab must be 3'2\u0026quot;. Use marine plywood for kitchen cabinets. Rain water harvesting is mandatory for all sites greater than 30x40. Provision electricity charging points for electric cars.
