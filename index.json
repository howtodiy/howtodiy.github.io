Same address and Karnataka DL.\nFor non-karnataka DL I am not aware of the process.\nAppointment Goto https://sarathi.parivahan.gov.in/ enter your existing DL and apply for DL renewal. Fill all the forms. Book appointment with the RTO nearest to you, appointments are available after 1 month only so plan ahead. Pay online (Sometime the payments don't go through, in which case you need to visit RTO in person to make payment) Uploading docs on portal need reduced size of photo, signature \u0026amp; DL. Use image editor tool to reduce the size of\nthe image to 150kb. On macbook its preview -\u0026gt; tools -\u0026gt; adjust size -\u0026gt; enter new width x height and save. You will have to upload scan copy of Photo, Signature, Old DL. Things To Carry When you goto RTO on appointment day you need\nA green envelope with your address and 18Rs stamp. Available in shops near RTO. Your new DL will be sent to you in this. Cost: 30 Rs in shops. Phone number should be written on this. A plastic pouch with your original DL. Form2 printout with colour photo attached. DL acknowledgement reference slip printout. Appointment date confirmation printout. Fees paid printout 351 Rs. Paid online. Form1-A medical certificate print + photo attached on this form, signed \u0026amp; stamped by doctor and mentioning doctor medical reference code. Govt doc took 50 Rs. Medical certificate is required for any age, even though portal says not required for below 40 which wrong. Form1 printout and signed. Aadhaar card + address proof. 60 Rs cash for smart card as it will be paid to third party vendor who takes the photo. RTO Visit You will first get the above list of docs verified at counter 2 (RTO) Then counter 1 (ARTO) will sign, check the docs again for any mismatch. Then you hand your documents to the officer in computer room counter 4. He gives you an acknowledgement slip. Then head to counter 8, they take your photo + signature, Give them 60 Rs cash for smart card, they will give you another acknowledgement slip. DL will come to your home in 30 days. In case you are unable to pay online due to server issue and it gets stuck. Then you need to visit RTO the on the appointment day, 1 hour before your appointment, goto counter 1 get docs verified and then goto computer room counter 4 and meet the officer in computer room who will unblock the stuck application, then you head to the physical payment counter and submit all the application docs + 351Rs cash and wait till he calls your name and hands all the docs back with a payment confirmation slip. Then go back to counter1 and start as mentioned above.\nTotal cost: 351 (application) + 30 (post cover) + 50 (doctor) + 60 (smart card) = 491 Rs.\nNote! For Non-Karnataka DL renewal I think its simpler to just apply for new DL. I think agents charge 6.5K to get the whole thing done.\n","link":"https://howtodiy.github.io/post/how-to-renew-dl-bangalore/","section":"post","tags":["Car"],"title":"How to Renew DL in Bangalore"},{"body":"Getting your car serviced in authorized service centers has become costly.
